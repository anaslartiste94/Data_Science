This README explains the steps done in the script run_analysis.R


1) get the X_train, y_train and subject_train data
2) get the X_test, y_test and subject_test data
3) concatenate column-wise X_train, y_train and subject_train => train
4) concatenate column-wise X_test, y_test and subject_test => test
5) concatenate row-wise the tables train and test
6) rename the variables
7) extract only the variables that contains mean or std in them and keep activity_labels and subject as well
8) change numeric labels into character labels
